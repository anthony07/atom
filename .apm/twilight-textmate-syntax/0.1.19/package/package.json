For example, the background is specified as `#181818` in Twilight.tmTheme, but color sampling the rendering on-screen yields `#202020`.\n\nNot all the colors have been re-sampled, it is a work in progress.\n\n![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/msmiley/twilight-textmate-syntax/master/screenshot.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/msmiley/twilight-textmate-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/msmiley/twilight-textmate-syntax#readme","_id":"twilight-textmate-syntax@0.1.19","_shasum":"ba8b18b7dde1acf7026251c447179652e784794b","_resolved":"file:../d-116129-4621-6bilhb/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116129-4621-6bilhb/package.tgz"}
